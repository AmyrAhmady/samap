# SAMAP
San Andreas high quality satellite map from GTA SA (48000 x 48000)

It's basically an image created by stitching tiles at max zoom level from https://gtagmodding.com/maps/gtasa/ , so any kind of credits for creating those tiles goes to them.

# NOTE
Seems like github has a very low limit of bandwidth, so a 280mb image can easily hit 1gb/month limit of bandwidth.
Here's an uploaded version of this image:
